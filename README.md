# Numerical Methods Using C Programming

Incase you've seen my other repositories of similiar category I've written all the programs specific problem oriented as given in our class. Though one with the basic knowledge of C can easily modify these programs but most of the time one prefer to see a program more in a general way as mentioned in the textbooks and again like to modify according to thier problem.
***This repository is under progress.***

## Do you want to download all the codes at once?
### For Linux user:
All the linux distributers have git installed in their system so they simply paste the following code in their terminal to get a local copy in your system.  
```
git clone https://github.com/singhnir/numerical-methods.git
```
### For Windows user:
Normally no windows has git preinstalled so previous command doesn't work on it but again you can download a zip copy of the codes clicking [**here**](https://github.com/singhnir/numerical-methods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Requirements
* Text Editor (Atom/Sublime...)
* GCC Compiler
* Gnuplot

## Similiar Repositories
* [DU-MSc-Lab-C-Prog](https://github.com/singhnir/DU-MSc-Lab-C-Prog) : This is my another similiar repository for the subject Computational Physics (Lab) - Course Code: PH-CL502 which I have completed in my M.Sc. Physics Semester: III course from University of Delhi.
* [DU-MSc-Phy-ANT-Lab](https://github.com/singhnir/DU-MSc-Phy-ANT-Lab) : This is my another similiar repository for the subject Advanced Numerical Techniques (Lab) - Course Code: PH-EL562 which I have completed in my M.Sc. Physics Semester: IV course from University of Delhi.
